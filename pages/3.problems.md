<!--
So in fact it's not that simple..

[click] And now, your product designer asks you to scale it and do more forms, more complex!

[click] Or your product manager, who's asking if we can make it so that form data is not lost on refresh of the page

[click] One of your colleague declares that it is time to change component library and switch to shadcn!

[click] And another colleague proposes to switch to TanStack form!

[click] And your designer again, who does not understand why it is still such a pain to build forms in 2025...

So why is it such a pain? Why is it that complicated?

# Form Mechanics vs Form Aesthetics

<!--
I think the problem in all this comes from the fact that the form mechanics and aesthetics are extremely entangled together

<!--
Let's go back. 

[click] This is what I call form aesthetics. It is the part that is focusing on what is rendered and how it is rendered: 
- is it a TextInput or a MultiSelect component that we should use here?
- how should we style them?
- where should they be placed on the screen?
- any business logic (show or hide a component dynamically)
etc..

The rest, is mostly framework specific plumbing. And altogether, it massively increases the cognitive load required to reason about the form.
